CyberWall: AI-Powered Security Monitoring System

A Flask-based security monitoring system that tracks logins, device
information, suspicious activities, IP addresses, and automatically
detects anomalies using Machine Learning.

FEATURES
1. AI-Powered Threat Detection 
2. Intelligent Device Tracking
3. IP Blacklist System 4. Login Attempt Monitoring 
5. Real-Time Dashboard 
6. Emergency Unblock (Dev Mode)
INSTALLATION 1. Install dependencies: pip install flask
mysql-connector-python pandas numpy scikit-learn bcrypt flask-limiter
2.  Setup MySQL database (tables: Users, Logs, Alerts, Blacklist,
    LoginAttempts)
3.  Configure credentials in code.

Why i made this:
This project was created as part of my learning and practice in cyber security, Flask development, and machine learning. The main purpose was to understand how real-world security systems work and how they detect suspicious activities.
1 By building this project, I wanted to learn how to:
2 Track login attempts and user activity
3 Detect unusual or harmful behavior using machine learning
4 Manage IP blacklisting just like professional security tools
5 Work with MySQL databases for storing logs
6 Create a real-time dashboard for monitoring security events
7 Understand device identification through browser and OS data

This project was created mainly for my personal learning and practice in Flask development, cyber security, and AI-based threat detection. It is not fully functional yet, and there are many areas that can be improved or expanded in the future. I may release updates later if I continue working on it.
I am uploading this project so that beginners in this field can get an idea of how a security monitoring dashboard works, how logs are tracked, and how machine learning can be used for threat detection. My goal is to help students understand the basics and inspire them to build more advanced versions in the future
